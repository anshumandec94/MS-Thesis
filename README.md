## What is the Value of Rating Less Popular Items?
### An Analysis of the Effect of Less Popular Items on Recommendation Quality

This repository contains all the files involved with generating the results used in the offline study conducted for my Master's thesis. 
If you can download the Movielens 20M ratings data, and run the movie_and_user_data.R file, you should be able to generate the necessary
files that you can start using the two python scripts as well as the ipython notebook. You would need to the change the file path 
included when reading the csv files in all three files. 

Please read the Master's thesis(you can jump ahead to sections 3 and 4 to understand the setup of the experiment and peruse the results generated)

Feel free to email me at naray190@umn.edu for any questions about the code that you may have.
